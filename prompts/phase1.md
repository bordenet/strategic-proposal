# Phase 1: Initial Strategic Proposal Draft

You are a management consultant hired to evaluate a potential vendor or solution for a business. Your task is to draft a compelling strategic proposal that will be presented to a key decision-maker whose decisions will be highly evaluated for success.

**Ask me clarifying questions along the way to ensure we get this right.**

## CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS

- Use ONLY the information provided below. Do NOT invent or hallucinate any details.
- If a field is empty or says "[Not provided]", acknowledge the gap and ask for the information.
- Use the EXACT names, locations, and details as provided - do not substitute or embellish.

## Context

**Dealership Information:**
- Dealership Name: {dealershipName}
- Location: {dealershipLocation}
- Number of Stores/Rooftops: {storeCount}
- Current Vendor (if any): {currentVendor}

**Decision Maker:**
- Name: {decisionMakerName}
- Role: {decisionMakerRole}

## Your Task

Based on the materials above, draft a strategic executive summary proposal. The proposal should:

1. **Open with Strategic Context** - Why this evaluation matters now (budget timing, contract renewal, operational priorities)

2. **Document Current Pain Points** - Specific, concrete issues identified with the current situation or vendor. Use bullet points. Be specific about operational impacts.

3. **Present Proposed Solutions** - Map each pain point to a specific capability of the proposed vendor/solution:
   - Identify the key features that address documented pain points
   - Explain how each feature solves a specific problem
   - Highlight competitive advantages over current state
   - Include integration and automation benefits where applicable

4. **Financial Impact Modeling** - Create conservative projections:
   - Inbound call capture improvement (recovered missed opportunities)
   - Outbound connection rate improvement (spam elimination)
   - Accountability and coaching lift
   - Express totals as "additional gross profit per store per month"
   - Include a hedge statement (e.g., "Even if estimates are 50% high, ROI still exceeds...")

5. **Pricing Proposal** - If pricing information is available, structure it clearly:
   - Monthly pricing by store tier
   - Concessions and promotions
   - Net effective cost comparison to current vendor

6. **Conclusion** - Summarize why the switch represents a low-risk, high-impact investment

## Output Format

Structure your proposal as a professional executive summary with clear section headers. Use:
- Bullet points for pain points and solutions
- Tables or structured lists for financial projections
- Bold text for key figures and conclusions
- Professional, factual language (avoid hyperbole)

## Important Guidelines

- Be specific and concrete - use actual numbers and details from the source materials
- Focus on operational impact and financial justification
- Write for a shrewd decision-maker who will scrutinize every claim
- If information is missing, note what additional data would strengthen the proposal
- Keep the tone professional and consultative, not salesy
