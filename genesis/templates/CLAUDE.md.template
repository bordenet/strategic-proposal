## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Fix ALL Linting Issues Immediately

**MANDATE**: When you detect ANY linting issue in a file you're working with, you MUST fix it immediately - regardless of whether it was pre-existing or newly introduced.

- Do NOT note that issues are "pre-existing" and move on
- Do NOT defer fixing to a later step
- Do NOT push code with known linting issues
- Fix ALL issues in the file before committing

**Rationale**: Linting issues indicate code quality problems. Ignoring them because they existed before your changes still means shipping low-quality code. Every touch point is an opportunity to improve the codebase. Sweeping lint errors "under the rug" causes them to accumulate over time, making each round of changes worse than the last.

## 🎯 Core Principles

### 0. **MANDATORY: Reference Known-Good Implementations FIRST**

**⚠️ BEFORE implementing ANY feature, reference these working examples:**

#### Primary References:
1. **[product-requirements-assistant](https://github.com/bordenet/product-requirements-assistant)** ⭐ **PRIMARY**
   - Dark mode toggle (CRITICAL - always broken without Tailwind config)
   - Workflow architecture (3-phase mock/manual pattern)
   - Form-to-prompt pattern
   - Deployment scripts (compact mode, quality gates)
   - Setup scripts (fast, resumable, smart caching)

2. **[one-pager](https://github.com/bordenet/one-pager)** ⭐ **SECONDARY**
   - Same workflow pattern, different document type
   - UI patterns (related projects dropdown, privacy notice)
   - Lessons learned from Genesis implementation

#### When to Reference:
**✅ ALWAYS check these implementations when:**
- Implementing dark mode (check `docs/index.html` lines 9-15 for Tailwind config)
- Setting up workflow phases (check `js/workflow.js`)
- Creating forms (check `js/app.js` renderPhase1Form)
- Writing scripts (check `scripts/deploy-web.sh`, `scripts/setup-macos.sh`)
- Adding UI patterns (check HTML/CSS patterns)
- **ANY TIME you're unsure how to implement something**

#### Create Reverse-Integration Notes:
**📝 MANDATORY: When you reference the implementations to solve a problem:**

1. **Add a note to `REVERSE-INTEGRATION-NOTES.md`** in this project
2. **Use this format**:
   ```markdown
   ## REVERSE-INTEGRATION NOTE #[NUMBER]

   **Date**: YYYY-MM-DD
   **Issue**: [What problem did you encounter?]
   **Solution**: [How did you solve it by referencing the implementations?]
   **Reference**: [Link to specific file/line in reference implementation]
   **Genesis Gap**: [What's missing from Genesis that caused this?]
   **Recommendation**: [What should be added/updated in Genesis?]
   **Files to Update**: [List Genesis files that need changes]
   **Priority**: [CRITICAL / HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW]
   ```

3. **Why this matters**: Every note helps improve Genesis for the next project. This creates a continuous improvement cycle.

**Example**:
```markdown
## REVERSE-INTEGRATION NOTE #1

**Date**: 2025-11-21
**Issue**: Dark mode toggle didn't work
**Solution**: Added Tailwind config from product-requirements-assistant/docs/index.html#L9-L15
**Reference**: https://github.com/bordenet/product-requirements-assistant/blob/main/docs/index.html#L9-L15
**Genesis Gap**: Missing Tailwind darkMode: 'class' config in templates
**Recommendation**: Add to genesis/templates/web-app/index-template.html
**Files to Update**: genesis/templates/web-app/index-template.html
**Priority**: CRITICAL
```

**Rule**: If you reference the implementations more than once for the same issue, Genesis is missing something. Document it!

### 1. **MANDATORY: Script-Only Deployments and Setup**

**⚠️ CRITICAL - READ THIS FIRST**:

#### Deployment Rule (ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENT)
**ALL deployments MUST be performed using project scripts. NEVER use manual git commands.**

```bash
# ✅ CORRECT - Use deployment script
./scripts/deploy-web.sh

# ❌ WRONG - Manual deployment
git add .
git commit -m "Deploy"
git push
```

**Why**: The deployment script enforces quality gates (linting, tests, coverage) before deploying. Manual deployments bypass these checks and can deploy broken code.

#### Setup Rule (ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENT)
**ALL project dependencies MUST be installed via setup scripts. NEVER tell users to run manual install commands.**

```bash
# ✅ CORRECT - Use setup script
./scripts/setup-macos.sh

# ❌ WRONG - Manual setup
npm install
brew install shellcheck
```

**Why**: Setup scripts ensure reproducible environments. Manual setup leads to "works on my machine" problems.

#### Required Setup Scripts
Every project MUST have these scripts in `scripts/`:
- **`setup-macos.sh`** - MANDATORY for all projects
- **`setup-linux.sh`** - If project supports Linux
- **`setup-windows-wsl.sh`** - If project supports Windows WSL
- **`setup-codecov.sh`** - If project uses code coverage tools
- **`deploy-web.sh`** - For web applications

**Reference**: https://github.com/bordenet/product-requirements-assistant/tree/main/scripts

### 2. **ALWAYS Complete the Full Workflow**
When asked to do a task, you MUST:
1. ✅ Complete the work
2. ✅ Lint the code (`npm run lint` or `npm run lint:fix`)
3. ✅ Run tests (`npm test`)
4. ✅ Verify tests pass
5. ✅ Check coverage if applicable
6. ✅ **PROACTIVELY tell the user what's left** - don't wait to be asked

**BAD**: "I've created the files."
**GOOD**: "I've created the files, linted them (0 errors), ran tests (37/37 passing), and verified coverage (73%). What's left: [specific list]"

### 3. **NEVER Include Build Artifacts**
When creating examples or templates:
- ❌ NEVER commit `node_modules/`
- ❌ NEVER commit `coverage/`
- ❌ NEVER commit `dist/` or `build/`
- ✅ ALWAYS create `.gitignore` files
- ✅ ALWAYS verify directory size before committing

### 4. **Proactive Status Updates**
After EVERY significant change:
```
✅ What I did: [specific actions]
✅ Quality checks: [linting, tests, coverage]
✅ What's left: [specific remaining tasks]
```

Don't make the user ask "what's left?" multiple times.

## 📋 Standard Workflow Checklist

### When Creating New Code
- [ ] **FIRST**: Check coding standards (see "Coding Standards" section below)
- [ ] Write the code following style guides
- [ ] Create/update tests
- [ ] Run linter: `npm run lint` or `npm run lint:fix`
- [ ] Run tests: `npm test`
- [ ] Check coverage: `npm run test:coverage` (if applicable)
- [ ] Verify all checks pass
- [ ] Create `.gitignore` if needed
- [ ] **Tell user: what's done, what's left**

### When Modifying Existing Code
- [ ] Make changes
- [ ] Update affected tests
- [ ] Run linter
- [ ] Run tests
- [ ] Verify no regressions
- [ ] **Tell user: what's done, what's left**

### When Deploying
- [ ] **MANDATORY**: Use `./scripts/deploy-web.sh` (NEVER manual git commands)
- [ ] Verify deployment script exists and is executable
- [ ] Let script handle linting, testing, coverage, commit, push
- [ ] Verify deployment URL after script completes

### When Adding Dependencies
- [ ] **MANDATORY**: Update `./scripts/setup-macos.sh` FIRST
- [ ] Update `./scripts/setup-linux.sh` if project supports Linux
- [ ] Add dependency to package.json/requirements.txt/etc.
- [ ] Test setup script works
- [ ] Commit setup script AND package file together
- [ ] **NEVER** tell user to run `npm install` or `pip install` manually

### When Asked "What's Left?"
This means you failed to proactively communicate. Improve by:
1. Always ending responses with "What's left: [list]"
2. Being specific about remaining tasks
3. Prioritizing tasks (blocking vs. nice-to-have)

# Deploy with verbose output
./scripts/deploy-web.sh -v

# Deploy skipping tests (emergency only)
./scripts/deploy-web.sh --skip-tests
```

### ALWAYS Run These After Code Changes
1. `npm run lint` (or `lint:fix`)
2. `npm test`
3. Verify output shows all passing
4. **Deploy using `./scripts/deploy-web.sh`** (NEVER manual git commands)

## 📐 Coding Standards

### JavaScript Style Guide
**Reference**: `genesis/integration/CODE_STYLE_STANDARDS.md`

**Key Rules**:
- Use ES6+ features (const/let, arrow functions, async/await)
- Single quotes for strings
- 2-space indentation
- Semicolons required
- Descriptive variable names (no single letters except loop counters)
- JSDoc comments for all functions
- Defensive coding (validate inputs, handle errors)

### Shell Script Style Guide
**Reference**: `genesis/integration/SHELL_SCRIPT_STANDARDS.md`

**Key Rules**:
- Bash shebang: `#!/usr/bin/env bash`
- `set -euo pipefail` for safety
- Compact mode for user-facing scripts
- Help flags (--help, -h, --verbose, -v)
- Smart caching for setup scripts
- Shellcheck compliance

### Testing Standards
- ≥70% code coverage (≥85% for production apps)
- Test all public functions
- Test error cases
- Use descriptive test names
- Mock external dependencies

---

## 📝 Communication Style

### User Expectations
- **No flattery**: Don't say "great question", "excellent idea", etc.
- **Be direct**: Skip pleasantries, get to the point
- **Be specific**: "37/37 tests passing" not "tests are working"
- **Be proactive**: Always end with "What's left: [list]"

### Status Update Template
```
✅ Completed:
- [Specific action 1]
- [Specific action 2]

✅ Quality Checks:
- Linting: PASSED (0 errors)
- Tests: PASSED (37/37)
- Coverage: 73% (exceeds 70% threshold)

✅ What's Left:
- [Specific remaining task 1]
- [Specific remaining task 2]
```

## Documentation Hygiene: Automatic Validation

**Problem**: Bootstrap projects accumulate documentation clutter over time - SESSION-CHECKPOINT files after work is complete, extensive "completed work" listings, references to deleted files. Developers have to manually remember to clean these up.

**Solution**: Automatic validation that runs on every commit and rejects commits containing:

- SESSION-CHECKPOINT.md files with no actual remaining work
- Extensive "✅ completed work" listings (indicates historical clutter)
- References to deleted files or directories
- CLAUDE.md files exceeding 600 lines (indicates accumulated cruft)
- TODO lists in projects marked as complete

**Implementation**: `scripts/lib/validate-docs.sh` (~188-line shell script that runs in <1 second).

**Benefit**: Documentation stays clean and focused without requiring manual enforcement. Developers get immediate feedback: "Remove that completed work section before you push."

**Where It Works**: All Genesis-bootstrapped projects - the script is generic enough to work for any documentation structure.

**Integration**:
- Pre-commit hook: Validates docs before commit
- CI/CD: Runs in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` to catch any bypassed hooks
- Template: Included in all Genesis-generated projects

**Usage**:
```bash
# Manual validation
./scripts/lib/validate-docs.sh

# Automatic validation (runs on git commit)
# No action needed - pre-commit hook handles it
```

**Common Fixes When Validation Fails**:
- Delete SESSION-CHECKPOINT.md if project is complete
- Remove ✅ completed work sections from documentation (move to CHANGELOG if needed)
- Update references to deleted files
- Remove TODO lists from completed projects
- Trim CLAUDE.md if it exceeds 600 lines

**Remember**: Match the user's high standards for professionalism and completeness.
